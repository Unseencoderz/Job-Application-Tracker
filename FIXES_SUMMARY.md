# Job Tracker Application - Fixes and Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Application API Issues ✅
**Problem**: Adding applications was not working due to field name mismatches between frontend and backend.

**Solution**:
- Fixed field name mapping in `AddApplicationDialog.tsx`:
  - `title` → `jobTitle`
  - `appliedDate` → `applicationDate`
  - `url` → `jobDetails.url` (nested object structure)
- Updated form data structure to match backend API expectations
- Fixed form reset and validation logic

### 2. Profile Update Issues ✅
**Problem**: Profile updates were not working properly due to incorrect data structure being sent to backend.

**Solution**:
- Updated `EditProfileDialog.tsx` to properly structure profile data
- Fixed API call to send data in the expected format: `{ profile: { ...profileFields } }`
- Ensured all profile fields are properly nested under the `profile` object
